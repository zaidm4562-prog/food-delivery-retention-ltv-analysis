## 1. Revenue is primarily driven by returning customers

### Revenue Breakdown

| Revenue Type | Total Revenue (₹) | Customers | Revenue per Customer (₹) |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| New Customers    | 17.13M          | 29,200     | ~587 |
| Returning Customers | 46.11M       | 26,312    | ~1,752 |


**Key takeaway**
- Returning customers contribute **~73% of total revenue**
- Revenue per returning customer is **~3× higher** than new customers


**Why this matters**
Sustainable growth depends far more on retaining existing customers than
continuously acquiring new users. Any decline in retention would have a
disproportionate impact on topline revenue.

## 2. Customer retention collapses early across all cohorts

### Retention Pattern (Mature Cohorts)

| Lifecycle Stage | Retention Range |
|----------------|----------------|
| Month 1        | ~50–55% |
| Month 3        | ~12–17% |
| Month 6+       | ~4–7% |

**Key takeaway:**  
- Nearly **half of customers churn after Month 1**
- ~80–85% churn by Month 3

**Why this matters:**  
Strong first-order conversion is not translating into habit formation.

## 3. Customer LTV declined as acquisition scaled

### 90-Day LTV by Cohort (Selected)

| Period         | Avg 90-Day LTV (₹) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Early 2023          | ~2,100 |
| Mid 2023 – 2024     | ~1,800–1,950 |
| 2025 cohorts*       | <1,000 |

\*Recent cohorts are immature and excluded from long-term conclusions.

**Key takeaway**
- LTV peaked early and stabilized at a lower level
- Larger cohorts did not improve per-customer value

**Why this matters:**  
Revenue growth has been driven by acquisition volume rather than improved customer quality.

## 4. First-order discounts materially reduce customer value

### Discount vs Non-Discount Customers

| Segment        | Customers    | Avg 90-Day LTV (₹) |
|----------------|--------------|--------------------|
| No Discount    | 13,105       | 2,040 |
| Discount Used  | 16,095       | 1,728 |

**Key takeaway**
- Discount-acquired customers generate ~15–18% lower LTV

**Why this matters:**  
While discounts increase conversion, they attract more price-sensitive users and dilute
long-term unit economics at scale.

## 5. Customer value varies significantly by city

### City-wise 90-Day LTV

| City      | Customers | Avg LTV (₹) |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Mumbai    | 6,498    | 2,059 |
| Bangalore | 6,098    | 2,049 |
| Delhi     | 6,431    | 2,021 |
| Lucknow   | 3,550    | 1,554 |
| Patna     | 3,171    | 1,535 |
| Indore    | 3,452    | 1,533 |

**Key takeaway**
- Tier-1 cities generate ~30–35% higher LTV than Tier-2/3 cities

**Why this matters**
Uniform acquisition and discount strategies across geographies dilute blended LTV.


---

### Overall Pattern Observed
Across cohorts, geographies, and acquisition channels, revenue growth has been driven by
volume rather than customer quality. Without improvements in early retention and repeat
behavior, further acquisition will continue to dilute long-term value.
