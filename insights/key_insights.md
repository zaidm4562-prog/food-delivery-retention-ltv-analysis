## 1. Revenue is primarily driven by returning customers

### Revenue Breakdown

| Revenue Type | Total Revenue (₹) | Customers | Revenue per Customer (₹) |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| New Customers    | 17.13M          | 29,200     | ~587 |
| Returning Customers | 46.11M       | 26,312    | ~1,752 |


**Key takeaway**
- Returning customers contribute **~73% of total revenue**
- Revenue per returning customer is **~3× higher** than new customers


**Why this matters**
Sustainable growth depends far more on retaining existing customers than
continuously acquiring new users. Any decline in retention would have a
disproportionate impact on topline revenue.
