## 1. Revenue is primarily driven by returning customers

### Revenue Breakdown

| Revenue Type | Total Revenue (₹) | Customers | Revenue per Customer (₹) |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| New Customers    | 17.13M          | 29,200     | ~587 |
| Returning Customers | 46.11M       | 26,312    | ~1,752 |


**Key takeaway**
- Returning customers contribute **~73% of total revenue**
- Revenue per returning customer is **~3× higher** than new customers


**Why this matters**
Sustainable growth depends far more on retaining existing customers than
continuously acquiring new users. Any decline in retention would have a
disproportionate impact on topline revenue.


## 2. Customer retention collapses early across all cohorts

### Retention Pattern (Mature Cohorts)

| Lifecycle Stage | Retention Range |
|----------------|----------------|
| Month 1        | ~50–55% |
| Month 3        | ~12–17% |
| Month 6+       | ~4–7% |

**Key takeaway:**  
- Nearly **half of customers churn after Month 1**
- ~80–85% churn by Month 3

**Why this matters:**  
Strong first-order conversion is not translating into habit formation.

## 3. Customer LTV declined as acquisition scaled

### 90-Day LTV by Cohort (Selected)

| Period         | Avg 90-Day LTV (₹) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Early 2023          | ~2,100 |
| Mid 2023 – 2024     | ~1,800–1,950 |
| 2025 cohorts*       | <1,000 |

\*Recent cohorts are immature and excluded from long-term conclusions.

Key takeaway:
- LTV peaked early and stabilized at a lower level
- Larger cohorts did not improve per-customer value

Why this matters:
Revenue growth has been driven by acquisition volume rather than improved customer quality.
