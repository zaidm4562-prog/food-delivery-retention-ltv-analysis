Analyzing customer retention, cohort behavior, and LTV to explain why revenue growth may hide long-term churn in a food-delivery business


# Revenue Is Growing, but Customers Are Not Returning
### A Cohort Retention & LTV Analysis for a Food-Delivery Company

---

## Business Context
This project simulates a real-world business problem faced by a food-delivery company operating across multiple Indian cities.

Over the last two years, the company has reported consistent month-over-month revenue growth. However, leadership suspects that this growth may be masking a deeper issue: a decline in customer retention and long-term customer value.

Initial indicators suggest that a large portion of recent growth may be driven by short-term, discount-acquired customers rather than repeat users. If true, this would pose a risk to sustainable growth, profitability, and marketing efficiency.

The objective of this analysis is to determine whether revenue growth is being supported by healthy customer behavior, or if churn and declining lifetime value are hidden beneath top-line performance.

## Business Questions
This analysis is designed to answer the following key business questions:

1. Is revenue growth primarily driven by new customers or repeat customers?
2. How does customer retention vary across signup cohorts over time?
3. Are newer customer cohorts generating lower lifetime value compared to earlier cohorts?
4. Do customers acquired through first-order discounts exhibit different retention and LTV behavior?
5. Are there meaningful city-level differences that influence retention and long-term value?

## Tools Used
- BigQuery (SQL)
- Python (synthetic data generation)
- GitHub

## Data Overview
The dataset used in this project is a high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed to closely mirror real food-delivery business behavior.

**Time Range:** 24 months  
**Geography:** Multi-city (Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3)  
**Scale:** ~120,000 orders

### Tables Used
- **customers:** Customer signup data and acquisition attributes
- **orders:** Order-level transaction data including discounts and net revenue
- **order_items:** Item-level purchase details
- **restaurants:** Restaurant attributes and city-level presence

While synthetic, the dataset intentionally includes real-world characteristics such as churn after first order, discount dependency, uneven cohort performance, and city-level behavioral differences.

## Metric Definitions
To ensure clarity and consistency, key metrics are defined as follows:

- **Retention Rate:**  
  Percentage of customers from a given signup cohort who place at least one delivered order in a given month after their first purchase.

- **Repeat Customer Rate:**  
  Percentage of customers with two or more delivered orders.

- **Lifetime Value (LTV – 90 Day):**  
  Total net revenue generated by a customer within 90 days of their first delivered order.

- **Discount-Acquired Customer:**  
  A customer whose first delivered order included a promotional discount.

Defining these metrics upfront ensures that all subsequent analysis aligns with business expectations and avoids ambiguous interpretations.

## Analysis Approach
The analysis follows a structured approach:

1. Validate top-line revenue growth and separate new vs repeat contributions.
2. Perform cohort-based retention analysis to identify decay patterns.
3. Compare 90-day LTV across cohorts to assess long-term value trends.
4. Analyze behavioral differences between discount and non-discount customers.
5. Evaluate city-level tradeoffs between short-term revenue and long-term retention.

Each analysis step is designed to inform a concrete business decision rather than simply describe historical performance.

## Expected Outcomes
The final output of this project aims to provide leadership with:

- Clear visibility into whether current growth is sustainable
- Identification of cohorts and segments driving long-term value
- Actionable recommendations to improve retention without sacrificing growth


**Key Insights**

Revenue is dominated by returning customers: Returning users contribute ~73% of total revenue, with per-customer revenue nearly 3× higher than new customers, making retention the primary revenue driver.

Customer retention collapses early: Nearly 50% of customers churn after Month 1, and 80–85% churn by Month 3, indicating that first-order conversion is not translating into habit formation.

Customer LTV declined as acquisition scaled: Average 90-day LTV peaked in early cohorts and stabilized at a lower level as acquisition volume increased, showing that growth came from scale, not improved customer quality.

First-order discounts reduce long-term value: Discount-acquired customers generate ~15–18% lower 90-day LTV, suggesting discounts attract more price-sensitive users who do not convert into high-value customers.

Customer value varies significantly by geography: Tier-1 cities generate 30–35% higher LTV than Tier-2/3 cities, indicating that uniform acquisition and discount strategies dilute blended LTV.

Growth is volume-driven, not value-driven: Across cohorts, cities, and acquisition channels, revenue growth has been driven by customer volume rather than improvements in retention or per-customer value.
