****📊 Food Delivery Retention & LTV Analysis****

Why Revenue Growth Can Hide Long-Term Customer Churn

**Executive Summary**

This project analyzes customer retention, cohort behavior, and lifetime value (LTV) for a food-delivery business to understand whether reported revenue growth is sustainable or masking long-term churn.

Although top-line revenue shows consistent growth, deeper analysis reveals that:

Retention drops sharply after the first order

Growth is driven more by customer volume than customer value

Discount-acquired customers generate significantly lower long-term value

The analysis demonstrates how relying only on revenue can lead to misleading business conclusions without retention and cohort analysis.

**Business Context**

The company operates across multiple Indian cities (Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3) and has reported steady month-over-month revenue growth.

However, leadership suspects that:

Growth may be driven by heavy discounting

New customer acquisition may be compensating for weak retention

Long-term customer value could be declining

This analysis was designed to validate these concerns using data-driven evidence.

**Key Business Questions**

Is revenue growth driven by new customers or returning customers?

How does customer retention decay across signup cohorts?

What is the 90-day LTV trend across cohorts?

How do discount-acquired customers behave compared to non-discount users?

Are there city-level differences in retention and LTV performance?

**Data Overview**

Dataset Type: High-fidelity synthetic data designed to mirror real food-delivery behavior

Time Range: 24 months
Scale: ~120,000 orders
Geography: Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3 cities

**Tables Used**

customers – signup data and acquisition attributes

orders – order-level transactions including discounts and revenue

order_items – item-level purchase details

restaurants – restaurant attributes and city presence

While the dataset is synthetic, it intentionally includes real-world issues such as early churn, discount dependency, uneven cohort performance, and city-level behavioral differences.

**Metric Definitions**

To ensure clarity and business alignment, the following metrics were defined explicitly:

Retention Rate
Percentage of customers from a signup cohort who place at least one delivered order in a given month after their first purchase.

Repeat Customer Rate
Percentage of customers with two or more delivered orders.

90-Day Lifetime Value (LTV)
Total net revenue generated by a customer within 90 days of their first delivered order.

Discount-Acquired Customer
A customer whose first delivered order included a promotional discount.

These definitions were fixed before analysis to avoid ambiguous interpretations.

**Analysis Approach**

The analysis followed a structured, business-first workflow:

Revenue Decomposition
Separate revenue contributions from new vs returning customers.

Cohort Retention Analysis
Measure monthly retention decay across signup cohorts.

LTV Trend Analysis
Compare early-cohort vs recent-cohort 90-day LTV performance.

Discount Impact Evaluation
Analyze behavioral and value differences between discount-acquired and non-discount customers.

City-Level Comparison
Identify geographic differences in retention and customer value.

Each step was designed to answer a specific business question rather than generate exploratory charts.

**Key Insights**

Revenue is dominated by returning customers, contributing approximately 70–73% of total revenue.

Customer retention collapses early: nearly 50% churn after the first order, and 80–85% churn by month 3.

Cohort LTV declines over time, indicating scaling acquisition is reducing average customer quality.

Discount-acquired customers generate 15–18% lower 90-day LTV compared to non-discount customers.

Tier-1 cities outperform Tier-2/3 cities, with 30–35% higher LTV, suggesting stronger customer stickiness and unit economics.

Overall growth appears volume-driven, not value-driven, increasing long-term risk.

**Business Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

Reduce first-order discount dependency in Tier-1 cities where organic retention is stronger.

Invest in post-first-order activation, especially within the first 14 days when churn risk is highest.

Segment acquisition strategies by city tier instead of using uniform discounting.

Track retention-adjusted growth metrics, not just revenue and order volume.

Monitor 30-60-90 day LTV trends as a leading indicator of customer quality.

These actions aim to improve long-term sustainability without sacrificing short-term growth.

**Assumptions & Limitations**

Churn is defined as no delivered order in a given month, which may misclassify infrequent users.

LTV is capped at 90 days due to limited long-term visibility.

Marketing channel cost data was not available, limiting CAC analysis.

Discount impact is measured only at first order, not across lifetime promotions.

These limitations should be considered when operationalizing results.

**Tools Used**

BigQuery SQL – data extraction, cohort construction, aggregations

Python – synthetic data generation and validation

GitHub – project versioning and documentation

**How This Analysis Helps a Business**

For founders, growth managers, and strategy teams, this analysis helps:

Detect hidden churn behind revenue growth

Identify which customer segments truly drive value

Optimize acquisition and discount strategies

Shift focus from volume-led growth to value-led growth
