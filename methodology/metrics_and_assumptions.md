# Methodology & Assumptions

This section documents how key metrics were defined, what assumptions were made,
and what limitations should be considered when interpreting the results.

---

## Data Scope
- Time range: Jan 2023 – Sep 2025
- Geography: Multiple Indian cities
- Order status: Only `Delivered` orders included in revenue and LTV calculations
- Dataset: Synthetic data generated to reflect realistic food-delivery behavior

---

## Metric Definitions

### Customer Cohort
Customers are assigned to cohorts based on the month of their **first delivered order**.
All retention and LTV calculations reference this cohort month.

---

### Retention
A customer is considered retained in a given month if they placed **at least one delivered
order** during that month.

Retention is measured at a monthly granularity.

---

### Lifetime Value (LTV)
LTV is defined as the **sum of net revenue** generated by a customer within a fixed window.

- Net revenue = order value − discounts
- Primary LTV window used: **90 days from first order**
- Recent cohorts with incomplete 90-day windows are excluded from long-term comparisons

---

### Revenue Classification
- **New customer revenue**: revenue generated from a customer’s **first delivered order**
- **Returning customer revenue**: revenue generated from all subsequent orders

---

## Discount Analysis
Customers are classified based on whether a **first-order discount** was applied.
No assumptions are made about discount usage beyond the first order.

---

## Geographic Analysis
Customers are grouped by city based on their signup city.
City-level LTV differences are interpreted directionally rather than causally.

---

## Key Assumptions
- Synthetic data approximates real-world ordering and retention behavior
- Customer behavior is assumed stable within cohorts
- Discount usage is treated as a proxy for price sensitivity

---

## Limitations
- Results do not account for marketing spend or CAC
- Lifetime value is limited to a 90-day window
- Restaurant-level effects are not explicitly modeled
- External seasonality effects are not isolated

---

## Interpretation Notes
This analysis focuses on **relative patterns and trade-offs**, not absolute forecasts.
Findings should be used to guide strategic decisions rather than predict exact outcomes.
